## Outcome variables

| Variable | Type | Description | Script |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dlog_NL` | Continuous | `log(NL_t) − log(NL_{t−1})` — year-on-year growth in nighttime light radiance | `run_nl_ols_pooled.py`, `run_nl_ols_by_state.py` |
| `delta_ndbi` | Continuous | `NDBI_t − NDBI_{t−1}` — year-on-year change in built-up index (level difference) | `run_ndbi_pooled.py`, `run_ndbi_by_state.py` |

## Treatment variable

| Variable | Type | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Seasonal_Ratio` | Continuous | [0, 1] | Fraction of AC area classified as seasonally flooded in a given year. Derived from JRC Global Surface Water 30m monthly composites. A value of 0.2 means 20% of the AC was under seasonal flood water that year. |

## Control variables

### Current-year controls

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `NL_mean` | Mean VIIRS/DMSP nighttime light radiance (nW/cm²/sr) within AC boundary |
| `NL_median` | Median nighttime light radiance |
| `NDBI_mean` | Mean NDBI within AC (see index definition below) |
| `NDBI_median` | Median NDBI |
| `NDVI_mean` | Mean NDVI within AC (see index definition below) |
| `NDVI_median` | Median NDVI |

### Lagged controls (t−1)

Suffix `_t_minus_1` denotes the one-year lag of the corresponding variable, constructed by merging the T-1 panel on `UNIT_ID + YEAR`.

| Variable | Used in |
|---|---|
| `NDVI_mean_t_minus_1`, `NDVI_median_t_minus_1` | Eq. 1 (NL outcome) and Eq. 2 (NDBI outcome) |
| `NDBI_mean_t_minus_1`, `NDBI_median_t_minus_1` | Eq. 1 (NL outcome) |
| `NL_mean_t_minus_1`, `NL_median_t_minus_1` | Eq. 2 (NDBI outcome) |
| `Water_SUM_t_minus_1` | Available; not used in main specification |
| `Water_SUM_t_minus_2` | Available; not used in main specification |

## Index definitions

### NDVI — Normalised Difference Vegetation Index

```
NDVI = (Band 5 − Band 4) / (Band 5 + Band 4)
```

Landsat-8 OLI bands: Band 4 = Red (0.64–0.67 µm), Band 5 = NIR (0.85–0.88 µm).  
Range: [−1, 1]. Higher values indicate denser green vegetation. Positive in vegetated areas; near zero or negative in bare soil, water, or built-up surfaces.

### NDBI — Normalised Difference Built-up Index

```
NDBI = (Band 6 − Band 5) / (Band 6 + Band 5)
```

Landsat-8 OLI bands: Band 6 = SWIR-1 (1.57–1.65 µm), Band 5 = NIR (0.85–0.88 µm).  
Range: [−1, 1]. Higher values indicate greater proportion of built-up/impervious surface. Frequently negative in rural and forested ACs.

| `UNIT_ID` | String | `{ST_CODE}_{DT_CODE}_{AC_NO}_{PC_NO}` — unique join key for T / T-1 merge |
| `DISTRICT_ID` | String | `{ST_CODE}_{DT_CODE}` — district identifier used for clustering |
| `YEAR` | Integer | Calendar year (2014–2019) |

| Column | MODIS IGBP class | Land cover class |
|---|---|---|
| `LC_2_ratio` | 2 | Evergreen Broadleaf Forest |
| `LC_4_ratio` | 4 | Deciduous Broadleaf Forest |
| `LC_5_ratio` | 5 | Mixed Forest |
| `LC_8_ratio` | 8 | Woody Savannas |
| `LC_9_ratio` | 9 | Savannas |
| `LC_10_ratio` | 10 | Grasslands |
| `LC_11_ratio` | 11 | Permanent Wetlands |
| `LC_12_ratio` | 12 | Croplands |
| `LC_13_ratio` | 13 | Urban and Built-Up Lands |
